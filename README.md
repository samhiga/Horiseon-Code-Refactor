## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://youtu.be/BFyeuLhjcPY)

This webpage provides information on the Horiseon marketing agency. Given the starter code, the task was to make sure the HTML elemants were semantic, that there was a logical structure to the code, that the images were accessible through alt attributes, and that overall everything followed professional and clean format. The result was a website that still maintained its look and function while code has been properly organized. 


Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

## Code Refactor Example

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


```html
<div class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
```

Converting the above non-semantic div with the class of 'header' to an appropriate [<header> semantic element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp). 

```html
<header>
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

```

This change require some additional modification to the CSS selector: 

```css
.header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```

No longer targeting the element on the page with the class of 'header' but instead the css selector targeting the 'header' element 

```css
header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}

```

## Usage 

The website is to be used to inquire more information on what Horiseon marketing agency provides its customers while also providing a smooth and functioning user experience that meets accesibility standards.

Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Learning Points 

Through this project, I was able to obtain a lot of new information. This information regards in how to make HTML elements are semantic
as well understanding how to make the CSS sheet correspond to this change as well. My ability to pinpoint and identify potential bugs within the 
code has improved as well and generally given me a better understanding of what code does what.

This is a good place to Explain what you Learned by creating this application.
This is a great way to remind about all of the Complex Skills you now have.
If the user is less experienced than you:
They will be impressed by what you can do!

If the user is more experienced than you:
They will be impressed by what you can do!

Remember, it is easy to forget exactly how Valuable and Impressive your skills are, as well as How Much You‚Äôve Learned!
So quantify that here!
